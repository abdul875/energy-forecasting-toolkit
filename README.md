🌿 Renewable Energy Potential Predictor
This project uses weather data and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the most suitable renewable energy source—Solar, Wind, or Hydro—for a specific location and time. By processing environmental indicators like solar radiation, wind speed, humidity, and precipitation, the system calculates energy scores and identifies the dominant renewable energy potential for each record.

🔍 Key Features
🌞 Solar Score based on solar radiation, UV index, cloud cover, and day length

💨 Wind Score using wind speed, gusts, pressure, and temperature

🌧️ Hydro Score from precipitation levels and coverage

📊 Automatic source classification: Solar, Wind, or Hydro

🧹 Handles missing data and normalizes values for fair scoring

📁 Supports district-wise weather reports (CSV format)

💾 Outputs annotated datasets with predicted energy source labels

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Joblib (for model persistence if extended)

Easily extendable with ML/DL models for future energy forecasting

📌 Use Cases
Renewable energy planning & policy making

Smart city energy grid analysis

Educational datasets for data science projects

Decision support for solar/wind/hydro infrastructure placement
